This section discusses project management and alternative approaches!

% i.	Explored possible alternative options based on unsuccessful powder extrusion
% 1.	Embedded printing or multiple filament printing
% a.	Worked on getting Prusa MMU2 up and running before deciding it was too finicky of a system
% i.	Created flowchart to help calibrate Prusa
% ii.	Discussed fine tuning tips with EED (Keevyn)
% 2.	Regrinding material
% a.	Methodologies and ideal dimensions
% 3.	Composite filaments
% 4.	Hydrogels
% a.	An option but not developed enough yet for our uses
% i.	We’d have to start from scratch
% 5.	FEM
% a.	Conducted literature review of existing FEM models for breast tissue
% ii.	Facilitated and underwent prototyping brainstorming
% 1.	Pugh Matrix
% 2.	Brainstormed ideas with Adrian on Post-it notes
% iii.	Created in depth Gantt chart based on possible new approaches
% 1.	Accounted for time and resource bandwidth
% 2.	Looked at how to explore multiple options in parallel
% iv.	Created RefWorks database to organize all references better
% 1.	Used many subfolders to group each reference
% v.	Lab rebranding and outreach
% 1.	Created new lab sign/name
% 2.	Presented at lab showcase to attract new research members
