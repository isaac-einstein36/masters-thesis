\subsection{Summary of PLCL Extrusions\label{methodology:extrudingPLCL:plclSummary}}

A significant portion of the research in this thesis pertains to extruding PLCL into a 3D printable filament. Multiple methods were employed to eventually achieve this. In summary, powder extrusions were first attempted. This was followed by manually and then automatically combining PLA and PCL pellets in a single screw extruder. Two extruders, 3Devo Filament Maker 1 and the Felfil Evo, were used to conduct these extrusions. Finally, shredding or regrinding the initial PLCL output and re-extruding was tested to address thickness tolerance concerns. Figure~\ref{methodology:extrudingPLCL:plclSummary} outlines this process at a high level.

Additionally,~\fullref{tab:appendix:extrusionSummary} details all extrusions performed and their results.

\subsection{Powder Extrusions\label{sec:methodology:extrudingPLCL:powderExtrusion}}

Based on material availability, the team attempted to extrude PLCL powder to create PLCL filament. While pellets are more commonly extruded than powders(See~\fullref{sec:literatureReview:extrusion:powder}), the team was unable to source PLCL pellets at a scalable price. As a result, Nomisma PLCL powder was used~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:387-nomisma} for these initial extrusions on a 3Devo Filament Maker 1 single screw extruder.

Prior to extruding, the PLCL powder was dried in a vaccuum oven at 45\textcelsius ~overnight based on the material manufacturer's recommendations. The Polymer Synthesis Research Facility (PSRF) at Ohio State University was utilized for this task (see~\fullref{sec:methodology:externalLabs:polymersLab} for more information on research conducted with this additional lab).

The powder was measured and poured into the extruder as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:methodology:extrudingPLCL:powderExtrusion}.

        \caption{Performing PLCL powder extrusion. Measuring powder (left) and pouring into extruder (right).}
        \label{fig:methodology:extrudingPLCL:powderExtrusion}
\end{figure}

In addition to pouring the powder, a pusher inspired by the Devostick was employed~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:396-3devotroubleshooting}. This is a rectangular piece of wood used to compress the material in hopes of resolving feeding issues. Using the pusher piece is shown below in ~\autoref{fig:methodology:extrudingPLCL:devostick}.

This extruder has four heat zones with heater 4 (H4) being closest to the hopper and heater 1 (H1) being closest to the nozzle. Heaters 4 through 1 were set to 205\textcelsius, 200\textcelsius, 195\textcelsius, and 190\textcelsius ~respectively based on 3Devo customer support recommendations. The RPM for the extruder was set to 3.5.

To achieve these temperatures, the extruder was first run at PLA presets (H4-H1: 170, 185, 190, 170 (all in \textcelsius)). Temperatures were raised to HDPE presets (190\textcelsius ~across all heat zones) and HDPE was introduced into the extruder. Finally, temperatures were raised to the PLCL extruding temperatures and the PLCL powder was introduced into the extruder. DevoVision was used to monitor extruder parameters and variables such as current and heater temperatures.

The results and discussion for this experiment can be found in~\fullref{results:extrudingPLCL:powderExtrusion} and~\fullref{discussion:extrudingPLCL:powderExtrusion} respectively.
