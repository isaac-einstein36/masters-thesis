\section{Evaluating Effects of Barium Sulfate\label{sec:methodology:effectsOfBaSO4}}

\subsection{Imaging Study\label{sec:methodology:effectsOfBaSO4:imagingStudy}}

A predominant goal of the barium sulfate extrusions and printing was to evaluate its effects on radiopacity. To measure these effects, an imaging study was conducted. This study was conducted in collaboration with the Stephanie Spielman Comprehensive Breast Center (OSUCCC).

\subsubsection{Sample Preparation\label{sec:methodology:effectsOfBaSO4:imagingStudy:samplePrep}}

Samples were prepared based on similar conducted literature~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:77-hamedani2018threedimensional}. A $1cm$ wide and $1cm$ tall cylinder was designed in SolidWorks, and numerous samples were printed for each barium sulfate concentration group. Based on supply of extruded filament, four samples were printed for each concentration group.

To eliminate air gaps, samples were printed with 100\% infill.

The various 3D printed samples for imaging are shown below in Figure~\ref{fig:methodology:effectsOfBaSO4:imagingStudySamples}

\subsubsection{Bonlecule Filament\label{sec:methodology:effectsOfBaSO4:imagingStudy:bonlecule}}

In addition to the custom-made PLA/BaSO\textsubscript{4} filaments, a commercially made radiopaque filament, Bonlecule, was also tested. A sample of this filament was sent from NOVUS~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:78-bonlecule}.

To 3D print Bonlecule, printing parameters from the manufacturer were used based initially on PLA Marble presets. Table~\ref{tab:methodology:bonleculeParameters} summarizes the final printing parameters used for this filament. Additionally, following manufacturer suggestions, glue was applied to the build plate to improve build plate adhesion.

Due to limited filament initially supplied, three samples of Bonlecule filament rather than four were printed for this imaging study.
