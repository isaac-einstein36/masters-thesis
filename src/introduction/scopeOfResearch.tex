\section{Scope of Research\label{introduction:scopeOfResearch}}

While substantial research has been conducted on the design and form factor of the end-product, significant research was necessary to inform the fabrication and manufacturing processes for the development of this device. This includes creating the custom material to fabricate this device as well as thoroughly evaluating material properties of this device.

A large portion of this thesis explores the development of a custom-made PLCL filament. This is eventually completed via extrusion of raw materials in pellet form, although multiple alternatives were also evaluated.

The infusion of barium sulfate as a radiopaque agent into filament was also explored. For simplicity and uniformity, effects of barium sulfate on PLA rather than PLCL as a raw material was evaluated. An imaging study as well as mechanical and material property testing was conducted to explore the effects of and optimize the required proportion of barium sulfate.

Given the lead time of developing PLCL filament, testing of this material is limited within the scope of this thesis. Additionally, infusion of barium sulfate in PLCL was not evaluated due to time and equipment limitations.
