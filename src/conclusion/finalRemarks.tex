\section{Final Remarks\label{sec:conclusion:finalRemarks}}

Refining the extrusion process of PLCL can make the development of new 3D printed PLCL-based devices possible and attainable for small-scale research.

This research also helps progress the development of a biodegradable continuously radiopaque 3D printable filament which can be useful in any treatment process where precise radiation treatment planning is required.

Lastly, with more accurate radiation delivery to a tumor bed following a lumpectomy procedure, breast cancer recurrence rates can be substantially decreased.
