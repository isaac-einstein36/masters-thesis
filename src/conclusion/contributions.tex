\subsection{Extrusion Process\label{sec:conclusion:contributions:extrusionProcess}}

A gap in the knowledge base exists regarding creating PLCL filament for 3D printing. This research provides a successful methodology for extruding PLCL filament on a single screw tabletop extruder. Filament thickness, however, still needs to be further refined.

\subsection{Automatic Pellet Dispenser\label{sec:conclusion:contributions:pelletDispenser}}

A novel automatic pellet dispensing system was developed to assist with automatically feeding an extruder. This system improves on existing manual approaches of feeding material into the extruder in a controlled manner, such as if the material is prone to melting prematurely.
