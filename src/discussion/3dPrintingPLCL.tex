\subsection{3D Printing Lattice PLCL\label{sec:discussion:3dPrintingPLCL:latticePLCL}}

This filament was relatively simple to optimize. By following the initial guidelines provided by Lattice Medical, minimal modifications had to be made.

As a result, it was hypothesized that the printing parameter optimization for custom-made PLCL filament may be similarly sstraightforward.

\subsection{3D Printing Custom-Made PLCL\label{sec:discussion:3dPrintingPLCL:customPLCL}}

Adjustments from a hardware (nozzle type) and software (printing temperature) perspective were made to address the repeated clogging the custom-made PLCL would cause in the printer hotend.

Because all changes to the printer itself did not resolve the clogging, it is likely that the custom-made filament is the contributing factor. Although the custom-made PLCL filament had an average diameter of $1.75mm$, the variability was outside the ideal bounds of ±$0.1mm$. It is possible this high tolerance contributed to clogging, and research should be conducted to create custom-made PLCL with a narrower margin of filament thickness.

Additionally, a procedure for cleaning hotend clogs should be established to quickly and efficiently remove clogs in the nozzle.
