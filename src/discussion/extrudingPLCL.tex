\section{Extruding PLCL\label{discussion:extrudingPLCL}}

\subsection{Powder Extrusion\label{discussion:extrudingPLCL:powderExtrusion}}

While this extrusion was successful in that filament was extruded, the extruded filament was unusable. When evaluating filament quality from a 3D printable perspective, there are numerous factors that must be considered (see~\fullref{sec:literatureReview:extrusion:issues} for a detailed explanation of these factors).

\paragraph*{Filament Output}
The filament was highly brittle and could snap easily. Although the powder was dried prior to extrusion and allowed to cool in air, brittleness was still a significant concern. This is the third extruder the team has used for powder extrusions (see~\fullref{sec:introduction:priorWork:otherTeamWork:plclExtrusions} for more information) and all three extruders led to highly brittle output. As a result, it is hypothesized at this point that a fully powder-based extrusion may create unusably brittle filament.

Additionally, the output was thin and experienced a variable flow rate. The Devostick pusher was used to address feed rate variability, but this did not adequately solve the issue. The variable feed rate and Devostick also led to concerning spikes in current as shown in~\autoref{fig:results:extrudingPLCL:powderExtrusion:currentOutput}.

Lastly, the filament had air bubbles inside indicative of temperature being too high. If the temperature is too high, the powder is likely degrading into a gas~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:396-3devotroubleshooting}. These air bubbles are shown below in~\autoref{fig:results:extrudingPLCL:powderExtrusion:airBubbles}

\paragraph*{Extrusion Process}

In addition to the filament output, there were concerns with the extrusion process as a whole. It was noted that the powder formed clumps (bridging) at the hopper. Even with the Devostick pusher, these clumps could not be consistently broken up which contributed to the variable flow rate. It was determined based on feedback from 3Devo customer support that this clumping is likely due to solely using powders and the heat zone temperatures being too high.

Also, the process of extruding powder was found to be chaotic and messy as well as inefficient. It was difficult to keep the powder from dispersing when transferring from the initial container to the hopper. This led to dirtying of equipment and wasted raw material.

\paragraph*{Key Takeaways}
% order feeder, powders will always be brittle
Key takeaways from this extrusion experiment are that: a 3Devo Feeder~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:310-3devofeeder} should be ordered to address clumping and variable flow rate, heat zones should be decreased to address clumping, cleaning supplies should be ordered to address powder dispersion, and alternative extrusion routes should be explored to address inherent brittleness of powder extrusions.

Because the Nomisma PLCL powder is expensive and has a long lead time, the team decided to pause powder extrusion research until the 3Devo Feeder arrived to avoid potentially wasting raw material.

\subsection{Pellet Extrusions\label{sec:discussion:extrudingPLCL:pelletExtrusions}}

\subsubsection{Combining Materials\label{sec:discussion:extrudingPLCL:pelletExtrusions:combiningMaterials}}

As mentioned in ~\fullref{sec:methodology:extrudingPLCL:pelletExtrusions:combiningMaterials}, various methods were explored to combine PLA and PCL pellets into a homogenous mixture.

\paragraph*{College of Pharmacy}

It was determined that the College of Pharmacy did not have adequate equipment to assist in mixing PLA and PCL pellets. Any mixing equipment they were able to provide was meant for small-scale (a few gram) mixing.

\paragraph*{Injection Molding}

While injection molding was deemed a possible option for combining these materials, it was eventually ruled out based on limitations of the equipment and the research team.

Discussions with professors at Ohio State University as well as a review of relevant literature made it apparent that injection molders could combine materials but would not reliably mix the materials homogeneously.

Various faculty were also hesitant to recommend injection molding given the steep learning curve and high setup time required to operate the equipment.

\paragraph*{Chemically Combining Materials}

After discussing the option of chemically combining the pellets with the PSRF (see~\autoref{sec:methodology:externalLabs:polymersLab}) using chloroform or DCM as a dissolving agent, the team was told this could not be done. For safety purposes, the PSRF no longer carries DCM or chloroform and is not allowed to work with these materials in most cases.

The final output of thermally combining the materials on a hotplate, as shown in~\autoref{fig:methodology:extrudingPLCL:meltingOnHotplate}, was too large to easily shred into extrudable pellets. Melting these materials in a shallower and wider dish may have resulted in a more shreddable output. However, this could not be done easily on a hotplate for the scale of materials needed for extruding. As a result, this rudimentary method of combining materials was eliminated.

\paragraph*{3D Printable Mixing Systems}

The research team decided that 3D printable tumbler systems were usable for mixing materials but that it may require more time than expected to fully assemble these systems. The team felt that if dedicated mixing equipment was requires this would be the fastest and cheapest approach. However, the team wanted to first see if they needed dedicated mixing equipment at all before spending time and resources in building these systems.

\paragraph*{Discussions with ISE Department}

Discussions with the ISE department were helpful in planning out multiple best and worst-case options for mixing materials given available equipment, time, and material constraints.

Dr. Mulyana was confident that dedicated mixing equipment was not required and that the pellets could be manually mixed in a container prior to extrusion. Due to a single screw extruder's inherently poor mixing capabilities, the limiting factor in creating a homogenous output would be the extruder rather than the degree of homogeneity of the pre-extrusion mixture.

To address this bottleneck, Dr. Mulyana offered the team uses a twin screw extruder in the ISE department. While this equipment would mix materials well, it would require high volumes of raw materials to run and time to learn how to use this equipment. It was decided that a twin screw extruder would be a viable backup option if using a single screw extruder did not mix materials well enough.

\paragraph*{Key Takeaways}

Many options were explored to combine PLA and PCL pellets into a homogenous mixture prior to extruding. Based on time, cost, safety, and anticipated limitations of equipment, injection molding, combining materials in a lab setting, and 3D printing a mixing system were no longer explored.

After consulting with Dr. Mulyana, the team opted to start by mixing pellets manually in a jar, leaving other methods for later consideration.
