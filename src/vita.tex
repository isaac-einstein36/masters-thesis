%% UPDATE FOR 2010:
%  Grad school only wants research publications, and it only wants those
%  research pubs that are actually published. Accepted or ``to appear''
%  publications don't count. If they look closely, they'll tell you to
%  remove any publications that aren't in print. Having said that, they
%  probably won't look that closely unless you put a really long list
%  here. You're tempting fate if you add instructional publications
%  though.
