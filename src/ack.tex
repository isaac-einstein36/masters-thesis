I would like to begin first and foremost by thanking my research advisor, Dr. Sandra Metzler. Thank you for your support, inspiration, trust, and belief in me throughout my college career. You've helped shape the engineer I strive to be, and my family and I are truly grateful for all your help, mentorship, and guidance over the many years we've worked with you.

Thank you, Adrian, for everything you've poured into this project. It's been wonderful working alongside you and getting to watch this project grow together. I wish you the best of luck with your PhD, and I'm so glad you'll be able to see this project that you've worked so hard on finally come to life.

To my parents, thank you for your unwavering love and support throughout this research and truly any endeavor I pursue.

To my siblings, thank you for always being just a phone call away whether that's to talk about this research or anything else.

To all my friends and family, I appreciate your support and guidance throughout my college career. I'm grateful for the strong relationships I have in my life, and they truly empower me to push and challenge myself each day.
