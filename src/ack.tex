\begin{acknowledgements}

I would like to begin first and foremost by thanking my research advisor, Dr. Sandra Metzler. Thank you for your support, inspiration, and trust and belief in me throughout my college career. You've helped shape the engineer I strive to be throughout my career, and my family and I are truly grateful for all your help, mentorship, and guidance over the many years we've worked with you.
