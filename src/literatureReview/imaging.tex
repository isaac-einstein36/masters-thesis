\section{Imaging Studies\label{sec:literatureReview:imaging}}
% Summarize imaging studies assessing radiopacity and HU quantification.
Imaging studies are important and often required for the FDA approval of any 510(k) implant device. Imaging studies are important in determining the radiopacity of the device and whether the device impacts imaging needs of surrounding areas~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:433-2023evidentiary}.

\subsection{Interpreting Hounsfield Units\label{sec:literatureReview:imaging:HU}}
Hounsfield units are the 

% Explain how HU correlates to material density and imaging contrast.
% RefID 332 (In Radiopacity, introduction talks about HU)
% RefID 363 Equation 2

\subsection{Test Standards\label{sec:literatureReview:imaging:standards}}
% Mention ASTM F640-20 and similar standards for CT evaluation (Ref ID 342)

\subsection{Prior Studies\label{sec:literatureReview:imaging:priorStudies}}
% Include references such as Ref ID 77 for comparable imaging validation studies.
