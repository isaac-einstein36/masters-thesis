Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in U.S. women and accounts for roughly 30\% of new cancer cases annually~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:36-2021breast,RefWorks:RefID:150-2025breast}. Common treatment for early-stage breast cancer is a lumpectomy procedure in which the cancerous tissue and a margin of surrounding healthy tissue is removed. This procedure is often followed by targeted radiation to kill stray cancer cells and prevent recurrence~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:165-czajka2023breast,RefWorks:RefID:159-depolo2024radiation,RefWorks:RefID:157-thomasscience,RefWorks:RefID:198-jiao2024interobserver,RefWorks:RefID:375-joosten2013evaluation}. Current methods of delineating the tumor bed for radiation planning have limitations~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:25-acree2022review}. A proposed solution is a 3D printed biodegradable continuously radiopaque implant created from Poly(l-lactide-co-$\varepsilon$-caprolactone) (PLCL) with barium sulfate (BaSO$_4$) as a radiopaque contrast agent~\cite{RefWorks:RefID:371-bakhtardesign,RefWorks:RefID:372-krakovskytumor,RefWorks:RefID:370-einsteinisaac}. This thesis describes the development of an extrusion methodology for producing 3D printable PLCL filament and examines the incorporation of BaSO$_4$ in PLA and its effects on material properties. PLCL was extruded from a 70/30 polylactic acid (PLA) / polycaprolactone (PCL) pellet mixture using a novel automatic starve-feeding pellet dispensing system and hopper insulation, resulting in an average filament thickness of 1.75mm. PLA with BaSO$_4$ concentrations of 0\% to 10\% were extruded and 3D printed. Imaging testing showed that 2.5\% BaSO$_4$ concentration provides adequate imaging contrast. Mechanical testing revealed a direct relationship between BaSO$_4$ concentration and flexural modulus, and limited effects in this range on yield strength and elastic modulus. This research establishes groundwork for future development of manufacturing methods and device requirements for the PLCL-based tumor bed marking implant.
